I used to think "home" was a place—a building with walls and a roof. 
But since I met you, I’ve realized that home is a feeling. 
It’s the safety I feel when I’m with you. 
It is the peace that settles over me when I see you happy.
Every single smile of yours feels like coming home after a long, hard journey.
I just wanted you to know how incredibly special you are to me. 
You are not just a part of my life; you are the best part of it. 
Thank you for being exactly who you are.
